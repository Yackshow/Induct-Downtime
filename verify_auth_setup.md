# Authentication Setup Verification

## Issue Identified
The auth.py module has been updated with the exact cookie loading pattern from your working code. However, there are two environment issues:

1. **Python packages not installed**: The system doesn't have `pip` installed, so the required Python packages (requests, beautifulsoup4, etc.) are not available.

2. **Cookie path mismatch**: Your Midway cookie is located at `/home/mackhun/.midway/cookie` (as shown by your mwinit output), but the script is running in a different environment where it's looking for the cookie at `/root/.midway/cookie`.

## Solutions

### 1. Install Required Python Packages
Since pip is not available, you'll need to either:
- Install pip first: `sudo apt-get install python3-pip` (if you have sudo access)
- Or install packages via system package manager: `sudo apt-get install python3-requests python3-bs4`
- Or use a Python environment that already has these packages

### 2. Fix Cookie Path
When running the script, either:
- Run it as your user (mackhun) instead of root
- Or copy the cookie to the expected location: `mkdir -p ~/.midway && cp /home/mackhun/.midway/cookie ~/.midway/`
- Or update the code to use an environment variable for the cookie path

## Updated Authentication Code
The auth.py file has been updated with:
1. Headers set BEFORE loading cookies (critical)
2. Session closed and recreated for fresh auth
3. Initial request to establish session
4. Error checking for login redirects
5. Exact cookie parsing matching your working pattern

## Next Steps
1. Install the required Python packages
2. Ensure the cookie file is accessible from where you run the script
3. Test with: `python3 src/auth.py`

The authentication pattern now exactly matches your working code, so once the environment issues are resolved, it should work correctly.
